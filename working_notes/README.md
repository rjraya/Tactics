# Ring-Theory (in Spanish)

A flavour of the topics the notes cover:

* Basic set and algebraic structures (monoids, groups, rings, ideals) theory.
* Special emphasis on ring constructions and examples.
* Integrity domains and fields.
* Principal ideals domains and their relation with diophantic equations, Euclid algorithm or the divisibility lattice.
* Congruences equations and systems of congruences. 
* Unique factorization domains and polynomial rings over them.
* Irreducibility criterion for polynomials. Kronecker's method for factorization.
* Some basic material about modules and finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain.
