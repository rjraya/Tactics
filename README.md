# Tactics

This repository contains work for a semester project in Computer Science in the LARA laboratory at EPFL.

My goal was to have an introduction to tactic reasoning in Isabelle as well as understand the categorical view on (co)induction principles. This (co)induction principles have been successfully implemented in Isabelle providing a (co)datatypes package that overcomes some soundness/limitations of other systems.
